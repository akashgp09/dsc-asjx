## About ASJ-X
DSC KIIT is organizing an Inter-University Hackathon ASJ-X, in order to help boost creativity in young developers. The goal of the hackathon is to pick a problem and come up with an application to help tackle it. There is no restriction on the type of Android application being created. Our mission is to build a community where the best talent could meet and collaborate towards future innovations.
- Checkout [ASJ-X website](http://asjx.dsckiit.tech/) for more details.
